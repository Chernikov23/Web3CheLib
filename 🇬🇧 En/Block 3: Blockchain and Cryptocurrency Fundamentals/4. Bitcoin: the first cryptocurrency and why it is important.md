To understand what Bitcoin is and why it came into being, **we need to mentally go back to 2008,** against the backdrop of the global financial crisis. Banks were collapsing, governments were printing money to save the economy, and confidence in the traditional financial system had been seriously undermined. It was at this moment that a person or group of people under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published a document describing the principles of a completely new monetary system — one that was decentralized and did not require trust in intermediaries.

If we think about the money we are used to, whether it is cash in our wallets or numbers in our bank accounts, **its movement is always controlled by some kind of center.** Banks keep track of who transferred how much to whom, and the state, represented by the central bank, decides how much money to put into circulation. Bitcoin offers a completely different model. At its core, it is the world's first fully digital cash that exists without any central governing body. Instead of a bank, there is a huge network of ordinary computers around the world with special software installed on them. This distributed network is the basis of Bitcoin.

The entire transaction history — who sent bitcoins to whom and when — is recorded in a special public database called a blockchain (chain of blocks). It can be compared to a huge digital ledger that is not stored in one place, but exists in identical copies on thousands of computers simultaneously. Each new block with a group of transactions is cryptographically linked to the previous one, forming a continuous chain. It is virtually impossible to falsify a record in a past block, as this would require recalculating all subsequent blocks on most computers in the network, which requires unimaginable computing power. This is what makes the system so secure.

The process of creating new blocks and, accordingly, new bitcoins is called mining. Computers on the network compete to solve a complex mathematical problem. The first to find the solution gets the right to add a new block to the chain and receives a reward in the form of a certain amount of newly created bitcoins, as well as commissions from transactions included in that block. It's like a digital gold rush, where powerful processors are used instead of picks and shovels. The most important principle laid down by Satoshi Nakamoto is limited supply. A total of 21 million bitcoins will ever be created. This predictable and unchanging issuance fundamentally distinguishes Bitcoin from traditional fiat money, which a central bank can issue in unlimited quantities.

So why do we need Bitcoin? Its value is multifaceted. First, it offers freedom from intermediaries. You can transfer any amount anywhere in the world directly to another person without asking permission from a bank, worrying about weekends or borders. The transfer is relatively fast, and the commission does not depend on the amount transferred. Second, it offers predictability in monetary policy. No one can unexpectedly “print” more bitcoins, which makes it an attractive tool for long-term savings, a kind of “digital gold” that protects against inflation. Thirdly, it is transparency and security. All transactions are anonymous (only wallet addresses are visible, not the identities of their owners) and can be verified by anyone in the blockchain.
