# The History of Money

**The history of money** is not just a chronicle of coins and banknotes, but a fascinating reflection of the evolution of human society, its trust, and ways of interacting. At its very origins, when the concept of economics did not yet exist, people used **barter:** livestock, grain, fabrics, or tools were exchanged for one another. However, this method was extremely inconvenient — it was difficult to determine a fair price for a bull in pots, and the bull itself was not always available. The search for a universal equivalent led to the emergence of the first money, which in different parts of the world took the form of cowrie shells, salt, beads, or even rare feathers.

But the real revolution came when people realized the value of metals. Their advantages were obvious: strength, divisibility, and relative rarity. At first, they were simply ingots or pieces of metal of a certain weight, like the gold cubes used in China as early as 1100 BC. To avoid cheating and constant weighing, the authorities began to stamp these pieces of metal, guaranteeing their purity and weight. This is how coins were born. Coin minting became a powerful tool of the state, a symbol of its sovereignty and economic power. In Ancient Greece and Rome, coins spread throughout the world along with trade routes and conquests, creating the first prototypes of unified economic spaces.

The Middle Ages brought new challenges. Transporting large sums of heavy coins over long distances, for example, to pay for goods from the East, was risky and inconvenient. This need gave rise to another ingenious invention — the bill of exchange. A merchant could deposit money in one city, receive a receipt (bill of exchange) from a specialized office, and upon arrival in another city, present it and receive his funds in local currency. These offices, in essence, became the precursors of banks.

One of the most powerful financial institutions of its time was the Genoese Bank of St. George. It no longer simply exchanged coins, but performed complex operations: it financed monarchs and maritime expeditions, managed the public debt of the Republic of Genoa, and conducted large-scale trade. The bank ensured its stability through government revenues, collateral, and even monopolies on resources such as salt production. Its reserves, consisting of gold, silver, and cash, were a solid foundation that inspired confidence in its counterparties. The activities of such institutions laid the groundwork for the next big step: the emergence of paper money.

Initially, banknotes were simply convenient **receipts** confirming that their owner kept a certain amount of gold or silver in the bank. Over time, people became more willing to exchange these pieces of paper than to carry heavy metals with them. Bankers noticed that not all depositors came to collect their gold at the same time, and it became possible to issue more banknotes than there was gold in the vaults — thus, lending was born. Gradually, trust in paper backed by the authority of the state or a reputable bank became sufficient for it to become money in its own right. This transition from real, tangible value to value based solely on trust was the most significant turning point in the financial history of mankind, which finally took shape in the 20th century.
