# What is money? 

If you go out on the street and ask the first ten people what they have in their wallets, they will show you pieces of plastic and colored paper. **But that's not money.** Those are just physical tokens, wallets for real money. So what is money, then? At its core, **money is not an object, but information.** Information about your share in the general economic agreement.

### Imagine a giant ledger 
Everything we call money — whether it's cash in your pocket, numbers in your bank account, or bitcoins in your wallet — is just a different way of accessing and recording entries in this global ledger. Cash is a bearer note from the central bank, the numbers in the Sberbank app are the commercial bank's obligations to you, and bitcoin is a cryptographically secured entry in a decentralized ledger that no one controls.

### Why does this ledger have any value at all?
Everything is based on trust. But **trust comes in many forms**. In the case of the ruble or the dollar, it is trust in the state, its economy, and its ability to ensure demand for its currency through taxes and laws. This is centralized trust. The value of the ruble is derived from trust in the Russian Federation.

So what is money today? It is, in essence, a standardized obligation. Rubles, dollars, and other currencies are obligations of the state, backed by its monopoly on force.

The main risk in this new reality is confusion about obligations. Do you trust the state? Then your choice is fiat. Do you trust algorithms and networks? Then your choice is Bitcoin. Do you trust a private company? Then your choice is stablecoin. A mistake in choosing the object of your trust can be costly.

Understanding this is **the key to financial literacy.** When you get your salary, you don't get pieces of paper. You receive an updated entry in your bank's database stating that it now owes you a little more. And when you spend, you simply allow the bank to change that entry. Money is the most liquid asset in the world, and its liquidity is determined precisely by the willingness of other people to take on the same obligations as you.
